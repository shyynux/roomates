Isn't it awkward when you have paid for a few dinners but you just feel shy asking your roommate to give your money back? I wanted to build a place an app where people can split money with each other without any hassle, without any conversations or arguments, just with one-click and that too using their web3 wallets. I wanted it to look clean and simple without overwhelming people. With roommates you can split your grocery, parties, snacks or shopping bills with one click. The person who owes will be notified that you have added the details and they can simply pay.

### What it does ☁️

    Hassle free authentication, handle by flow. Use Blocto or Flow Ref or Flipper to login.
    set a unique and cool username.
    The username is also updated on the blockchain.
    Enter the amount and the percentage split and the username of your friends.
    Roommate will notify your friends to pay.

### How I built it 🪵

    I used Flow for authentication, nextJs, React and typescript and stored user details on firebase. This is the first time I used something related to web3 and this was also my first time using nextJs and firebase database as well.
    With Flow I was able to use testnet and test tokens without spending any real money

### What I learnt 🟢

  Web3 is happening, it has a lot of potential and it is something people are really sleeping on it, It was very exciting to know and understand web3 terms and explore it.
  building fast and non-stop
  I pivoted a lot as I was not able to decide what to pick but flow's docs and beginner friendly vibe made me learn it.
  I also now have a metamask wallet and I am really looking forward to build in Next as it is so smooth with vercel.

###What's next for Roommates 🤍

  - Integrating Flow wallet so that people can transact in flow tokens making it a complete flow payment app, not just expense splitting.
  - Integrating metamask wallet so payments can happen in-app.
  - Add different groups so that people can have different groups of friend stored in-app
